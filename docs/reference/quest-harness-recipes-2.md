## Horror from the Deep — stage-scoped harness

[`e2e/horror-deep-216-live.ts`](../../e2e/horror-deep-216-live.ts), same shape,
also members-only:

```sh
HEADED=1 bun e2e/horror-deep-216-live.ts --stage 0 --until 10 --minutes 210        # end to end
HEADED=1 bun e2e/horror-deep-216-live.ts --stage 4 --until 5 --seedkit --minutes 25 # the strange wall
HEADED=1 bun e2e/horror-deep-216-live.ts --stage 1 --barcrawl 0 \
  --bits horrorbridgeleft,horrorbridgeright --minutes 120                            # the barcrawl
HEADED=1 bun e2e/horror-deep-216-live.ts --stage 0 --until 10 --teleports          # end to end, hops on
```

Four things it does that the Family Crest one does not:

- **Deploys `navworker.js` as well as `botclient.js`.** The transport graph is
  compiled into the nav worker, which is its own entrypoint, so a run that
  deploys only the client walks on the old edges — and the symptom is a flat
  `no path to (…): unreachable` for a route the offline probe likes.
- **Seeds every `deephorror` sub-bit that the stage implies.** The bridge, the
  key and the three lamp repairs are separate bits of one varp, so a bare
  `setvar horrorquest 4` describes a state the quest cannot reach.
- **`--seedkit` hands over the dungeon load** so a run can iterate on the wall or
  the fight without the twenty-minute Varrock round trip. It is a debugging
  shortcut: leave it off for anything that claims the quest works, or the item
  sourcing is never exercised.
- **`--teleports` turns the Global `navTeleports` setting on *and banks law
  runes*.** Both halves are load-bearing. The nav layer only injects a hop the
  live inventory can pay for, and law is the one rune the module will not shop
  for — the Magic Guild and the Mage Arena are the only two shops that stock it
  — so flipping the toggle against a bank without law measures the walking run
  again under a different name.

Measured end to end at `--tick 200`: **68 minutes walking, 45 with `--teleports`**
(16 hops — Camelot ×11, Varrock ×3, Falador, Lumbridge — and no parks).

**Pin `--tick` when you are comparing two runs.** The default is 300ms and the
end-to-end baseline was measured at `--tick 200`; a run at the default is 1.5×
slower per tick, so any wall-clock comparison against it measures the flag. Two
runs at 300ms also wedged on the first step, with Larrissa one tile away
and every `Talk-to` refused in silence — the nav probe rules out geometry (all
the tiles around her are mutually reachable at cost 1) and the engine's own
recovery named a leftover **main** modal, which refuses dialogue like
this. The poll line now prints `MAIN-MODAL=<id>` whenever one is open, so the
next occurrence names the interface instead of having to be inferred.

Two more tools sit alongside it.
[`e2e/horror-journal-dump.ts`](../../e2e/horror-journal-dump.ts) prints the
quest journal verbatim at each stage — `~quest_journal` word-wraps the page and
re-emits the active colour tags on every line it produces, so needles have to be
written against what the client receives, not against the `.rs2`.
[`tools/nav/horror-probe.ts`](../../tools/nav/horror-probe.ts) checks every tile the
module names against a flood from the mainland, and lists the sealed pockets
deliberately so a map change fails loudly instead of quietly.

Next lower probe (update `EW_PROVEN_COMBAT_FLOOR` only if green):

```sh
HEADED=1 bun e2e/aio-quest-test.ts http://localhost:8890 ewprobe elemental_workshop 25 \
  'bank:knife:1,bank:hammer:1,bank:bronze_pickaxe:1,bank:thread:2,bank:leather:1,bank:needle:1,bank:coal:8,bank:lobster:25,bank:steel_scimitar:1,bank:coins:50000' \
  'mining:20,smithing:20,crafting:20,attack:45,strength:45,defence:30,hitpoints:45' \
  Lobster 'speed 300' '2725,3491'
```

Expect `check the bank` / `withdraw` after book/key. After journal **ENTERED**,
death recovery re-enters with **Push** (no key) and re-withdraws bank tools.

**Recipe for future quest harnesses:**

1. Prefer `bank:obj:qty` / `givebank` / `~bankitem` over give→deposit loops for unstackable food.
2. Ideal smoke → realistic bank-seed → **lower non-required stats until red**;
   keep proven floor + failed floor + next probe in the module; `warnReadiness`.
3. Leave the pack empty after bank seed so provisioning runs.
4. Drain dialogs before `~bankitem`; prefer `givebank` mid-setup.
5. Assert journal complete + clean stop.
6. Later: power-level tactics (safespot vs melee) from the same skill snapshot.

- **`::death` is a clean kill** (`~damage_self(999)`): respawn is Lumbridge `(3221,3218)`,
  and `move_priciest_item_on_hero_to_death` keeps *one* of each of the three priciest items
  — so a coin stack comes back as a single coin. Use it to drive death recovery through a death
  rather than seeding a post-death pose.
- **A stage test seeds only what that stage produces, never its tools.** See
  [Quests](../how-to/add-a-quest.md) — every Watch Tower stage-10 test handed the bot
  a pickaxe, so all of them passed while the quest could not mine.
  [`e2e/shilo-solo-test.ts`](../../e2e/shilo-solo-test.ts) is the current worked
  example: `--stage`/`--bits` jump the quest varps, `--tele` drops the account beside
  the leg under test, and `--speed 300` runs the engine at 2× ticks.
- **Measure throughput per tick, never per hour.** A dev world does not tick at 600ms
  and `--speed` changes it again, so an actions/hour figure read off a sim is fiction.
  [`e2e/roguespurse-test.ts`](../../e2e/roguespurse-test.ts) reports herbs/**tick**
  from the `host.tickCount` delta, which is comparable to the engine's own limits
  (5 user events per tick) and to a 600ms world.

## Nature Spirit — stage-scoped harness

[`e2e/naturespirit-239-live.ts`](../../e2e/naturespirit-239-live.ts), members-only,
so `:8890`:

```sh
HEADED=1 bun e2e/naturespirit-239-live.ts --stage 0 --until 110 --minutes 120 --tick 200  # end to end
HEADED=1 bun e2e/naturespirit-239-live.ts --stage 0 --until 40 --minutes 45 --tick 200    # camp chain
HEADED=1 bun e2e/naturespirit-239-live.ts --stage 40 --until 75 --minutes 30 --tick 200   # ritual and grotto
HEADED=1 bun e2e/naturespirit-239-live.ts --stage 70 --until 85 --minutes 20 --stocked    # the sickle
HEADED=1 bun e2e/naturespirit-239-live.ts --stage 85 --until 110 --minutes 30 --tick 200  # the ghasts
```

Three things it does beyond the Horror shape:

- **Sets both prerequisites.** Eligibility reads the quest-list colour, so
  `prieststart` and `priestperil` are set and the run relogs — `update_questlist`
  only recolours at login. `priestperil` goes to 61, not 60: the Salve barrier the
  route depends on is `^priestperil_access_holy_barrier`.
- **Gives the pack what the stage implies.** A mid-quest start hands over the
  ghostspeak amulet, and from stage 75 the blessed sickle and a druid pouch — both
  come from Filliman, so a run seeded past him otherwise describes an unreachable
  state. Stage 0 gets none of it, which is what makes the end-to-end run the proof.
- **`--stocked` banks a mould and a silver bar** — ordinary clutter on an
  established account, and the only way to reach the cast without the Al Kharid
  round trip. Leave it off for anything claiming the quest works.

The bank holds coins and food alone by default. Nothing seeds a pickaxe: mining
without one raises no refusal at all, so a seeded run would pass while the quest
could not mine.

Measured end to end at `--tick 200`: **19 minutes, 37 steps, no parks** — walking,
with no teleports. Roughly half of that is the Mort Myre ↔ Al Kharid round trip the
silver sickle costs.
