## Family Crest — stage-scoped harness

Family Crest is eleven server stages across four kingdoms, so it has its own
harness rather than a `e2e/aio-quest-test.ts` invocation:
[`e2e/family-crest-210-live.ts`](../../e2e/family-crest-210-live.ts). It seeds a
fixed bank, jumps `%crestquest`, and passes when the journal reaches `--until`.

```sh
HEADED=1 bun e2e/family-crest-210-live.ts --stage 7 --until 8 --minutes 28   # the gold mine
HEADED=1 bun e2e/family-crest-210-live.ts --stage 0 --minutes 120            # end to end
```

Two things that harness has to do and a plain `setvar` does not:

- **Relog after the stage jump.** `update_questlist` recolours the journal entry
  at login only, and every module reads the tab rather than the varp — so a
  `setvar crestquest 7` without a relog leaves the quest reading *not started*.
- **Clear `crest_spells_levers_gauntlets` too.** The lever bits and the
  four-blasts-cast bits share that varp, so a stage jump that leaves it set
  starts Chronozon already weakened and the fight proves nothing.

It is **members-only** (`map_members`), so it needs the :8890 world, not :8888.

Caleb's five cooked fish and the two rubies are bank seeds by design — no shop
in the game stocks cooked bass or shrimp, and the Ardougne gem merchant restocks
a single ruby every 60k ticks. Everything else (moulds, antipoison, blast runes,
a pickaxe) is bought live.

## Fight Arena — stage-scoped harness

[`e2e/fight-arena-233-live.ts`](../../e2e/fight-arena-233-live.ts). Members content, so
`:8890` only.

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--stage N` | 0 | `setvar arenaquest N`, then relog so the quest list recolours |
| `--until N` | 14 | stop at this stage; 14 waits for the journal to go green |
| `--tick N` | 150 | server tick in ms; 150 is double speed |
| `--minutes N` | 120 | wall-clock budget |
| `--food NAME` | Lobster | the AIO Quester's food setting |
| `--no-deploy` | off | skip the build and copy |

It deploys **its own copy of the client** through `deployIsolatedClient`: everything in
`out/` lands in `public/bot/<user>/`, and a generated `bot-<user>.html` points at it. Two
runs on one engine no longer overwrite each other, and the copy is swept on exit. That
also carries `navworker.js` and `collision.lcnav.gz`, both of which this quest needs —
refusing the arena's doors changed the transport graph, and a client-only deploy leaves
the navigator on the old edges.

The bank seed is coins, food and a rune melee kit — `rune_chainbody` rather than
`rune_platebody`, which wants Dragon Slayer. Nothing the quest can find in the world is
seeded: the Khazard disguise comes from the chest, the keys from the drunk guard and the
brew from the barman.

Stage starts: 1 and 2 at the chest, 3 and 5 outside the guard door, 6 and 8 on the arena
floor, 9 in the prison cell, 10 to 12 on the arena floor.

What the legs proved, at `--tick 150` on `:8890`:

| Leg | Result | What it covered |
|---|---|---|
| 0 → 2 | PASS, 1 min | Lady Servil, the journal parse, the chest's north-only stand, the disguise, the guard door |
| 2 → 5 | PASS, 3 min | the drunk guard, the walk out for a brew (`coins 1000→995`), the keys (`khali brew 1→0, cell keys 0→1`) |
| 5 → 9 | PASS, 3 min | the keys reclaimed after a death, the cell-gate cutscene, the ogre — 10 attacks, no damage taken under Protect from Melee |
| 9 → 12 | PASS, 5 min | Hengrad's cutscene out of the cell, the scorpion, Bouncer, the agreement — hitpoints never left 99, prayer 99 → 53 |
| 12 → 14 | PASS, 2 min | both scripted doors outward, the walk to Lady Servil, `QUEST COMPLETE`, 2 quest points |
| 0 → 14 | PASS, 7 min | the uncheated run: 26 steps, no parks, nothing seeded but coins, food and a banked rune kit |

The 5 → 9 leg overshoots its `--until 8` on purpose, and a leg that starts inside a pocket
spends its first three minutes watching the engine fail to reach a bank. Both are
explained in [Fight Arena's pitfalls](../decisions/quest-pitfalls-4.md).

## Fishing Contest — stage-scoped harness

[`e2e/fishing-contest-244-live.ts`](../../e2e/fishing-contest-244-live.ts). Members
content, so `:8890` only.

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--stage N` | 0 | the `%fishingcompo` value, 0 to 4, with its companion varps and the pass |
| `--until N` | 5 | stop at this stage; 5 waits for the journal to go green |
| `--tick N` | 300 | server tick in ms; 150 is double speed |
| `--minutes N` | 75 | wall-clock budget |
| `--food NAME` | Lobster | the AIO Quester's food setting |
| `--stats N` | 99 | every skill, since the road crosses White Wolf Mountain |
| `--no-deploy` | off | skip the build and copy |

It deploys **its own copy of the client** through `deployIsolatedClient`: everything in
`out/` lands in `public/bot/<user>/` and a generated `bot-<user>.html` points at it, so a
neighbouring harness cannot decide mid-boot which branch this run exercises. The copy is
swept on exit, and it carries `navworker.js` and `collision.lcnav.gz` — this quest walks
from Draynor to Kandarin, so a client-only deploy would leave the navigator on old edges.

`--stage` writes three varps rather than one. `%fishingcompo` is the contest stage,
`%hemenster_comp_stage` counts the fee and the catches, and `%hemenster_pipe_stashed`
records the clove — and Bonzo re-seats a contest whose fee counter disagrees with the
stage, so a bare `setvar fishingcompo 3` describes a state the engine will not honour.
Each is read back, and the seed relogs because `update_questlist` recolours the tab at
login only.

The bank holds coins and food and nothing else: the clove comes from Morgan's cupboard in
Draynor, the spade from a house floor, the rod from Harry's in Catherby and the worms from
McGrubor's Wood. Stage 0 and 1 start at the Draynor bank; 2 and up start at Catherby,
because past the fee the quest never leaves Kandarin.

`--stage 2` is the exception: it hands over a clove, a rod and five worms, because a
character standing in a paid-up contest is carrying them, and making that leg walk to
Draynor for a clove buries the garlic stash it exists to test under a fifteen-minute round
trip. `--stage 3` seeds nothing, so it still proves the rod and the worms are sourced.

What the legs proved, at `--tick 150` on `:8890`:

| Leg | Result | What it covered |
|---|---|---|
| 0 → 5 | **PASS, 6 min** | the uncheated run: 16 steps, no parks, `QUEST COMPLETE` and 1 quest point |
| 2 → 4 | PASS, 2 min | the gate, the garlic stash, three carp — zero failed steps |
| 3 → 4 | PASS, 4 min | the rod at Harry's, the spade at Edmond's, the worm dig and three carp |

Every leg is proved by an inventory delta rather than a log line: `garlic 0→1` at the
cupboard, `spade 0→1` at the spawn, `fishing pass 0→1` from the dwarf, `coins 1000→995`
at Harry's, `red vine worm 0→5` in the wood, `coins 995→990` to Bonzo, `garlic 1→0` at the
pipe, three `raw giant carp` and finally `fishing trophy 1→0`. The eleven pitfalls the
live runs paid for are in [Fishing Contest's pitfalls](../decisions/quest-pitfalls-13.md).

## Hero's Quest — pair harness

[`e2e/heros-quest-pair-249-live.ts`](../../e2e/heros-quest-pair-249-live.ts) runs both gangs at
once, because neither half finishes alone: `grip_attack` refuses everyone but a Phoenix member,
`pete_treasuredoor` and the candlestick chest answer only to a Black Arm member who has given Grip
the papers, and `open_and_close_door` teleports the actor rather than opening, so the Phoenix bot
crosses the side door only on the spare key its rival trades over.

```
--stage grip|armband|full   where to start and stop
--stats N                   setstat every skill to N (default 70)
--tick MS                   engine tick, default 300
--minutes N                 wall-clock budget
```

`--stage grip` is the iteration loop: it sets `%heroquest` to 11 and 4 — the two stages the Brimhaven
dance begins at — banks the Phoenix bot's bow and arrows, and skips the shopping and the gang legs,
which take ten minutes a side and are proven on their own. Both bots still start at the Varrock booth
and walk the crossing, because `ownsInventory` makes the first step a bank read and Karamja has no
bank at all.

One `browser.newContext()` per account, as for Shield of Arrav. The gang is **not** a setting of
this quest — `heroGang()` reads Shield of Arrav's `arravGang`, so a character walks the same side in
both quests; the harness sets `arravGang` per page and `heroPartner` to the other name.

Prerequisites are set rather than earned: `zanaris`, `dragonquest`, `arthur`, `qp 55` and exactly
one of `phoenixgang 10` / `blackarmgang 4`. Setting both gang varps offers a bot both sides of the
quest, which is not a state any account reaches.

Shop stock is world state, so back-to-back runs contend for it: the third field of a `stock<N>=`
line is the restock rate in ticks, and Valaine's black platelegs are 20 000 of them — nearly two
hours at `--tick 300`. The disguise names Louie in Al Kharid first for that reason, and a run that
finds a shelf empty waits rather than fails.

The bank seed is coins, lobsters and **ice gloves**. The gloves are the one seeded quest item, and
the reason is in [Hero's Quest pitfalls](../decisions/quest-pitfalls-14.md): every ladder into the
Ice Queen's lair stands on a plateau the map flags seal, so nothing can walk to the only source of
them. `--stage armband` avoids the question entirely and is the fast loop for the two-bot dance.

## Hero's Quest — items harness

[`e2e/heros-quest-items-249-live.ts`](../../e2e/heros-quest-items-249-live.ts) is the one-account
half: it sets `%heroquest` to 13, seeds an armband, and watches the eel, the feather and the
hand-in.

```
--skip-eel                 seed a cooked lava eel instead of earning it
--skip-feather             seed a fire feather instead of earning it
--stats N / --tick MS / --minutes N   as above
```

Budget it generously. The eel is nine legs deep before a line is cast: about 25 chaos druids for
the harralander, Ardougne for the vial, Port Sarim for the slime and the rod, the Jailer for the
jail key, Velrak for the dusty key, then the gate into the deep dungeon, the lava spot and the
Catherby range. The two keys are kept, so a re-run resumes at whichever of them is already banked.
