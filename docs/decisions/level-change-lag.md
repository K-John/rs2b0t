# Level-change loc lag

**Every scene query is empty for about a tick after the level changes.** Climb a
ladder and immediately ask for nearby locs, and you get nothing — not because nothing
is there, but because the scene has not been rebuilt yet.

This is the single most expensive gotcha in this subsystem: blank looks exactly like
absent, so code concludes an object is missing and starts a recovery it never needed.
It caused a false "the crystal broke" wander loop at the Camelot tower, and phantom
ladder detours in the walker.

The executor settles after any level-changing transport before trusting the scene
([`WalkExecutor.ts`](../../src/bot/nav/WalkExecutor.ts)):

```ts
if (crossed) {
    if (transport.toLevel !== undefined) {
        await Execution.delayTicks(2);
    }
```

**Rule: require positive evidence of scene sync before concluding something is
absent.** An empty result immediately after a level change means "ask again".
